    "dc:description": "SOMMERVILLE Software Engineering 8 The eighth edition of the best-selling introduction to software engineering is now updated with three new chapters on state-of-the-art topics. New chapters in the 8th edition Oslash; Security engineering, showing youhow you can design software to resist attacks and recover from damage;Oslash; Service-oriented software engineering, explaininghow reusable web services can be used to develop new applications;Oslash; Aspect-oriented software development, introducing new techniques based on the separation of concerns. Key features Oslash; Includes the latest developments in software engineering theory and practice, integrated with relevant aspects of systems engineering.Oslash; Extensive coverage ofagile methods andreuse.Oslash; Integrated coverage of system safety, security and reliability ndash; illustrating best practice in developing critical systems.Oslash; Two running case studies (an information system and a control system) illuminate different stages of thesoftware lifecycle. Online resources Visit www.pearsoned.co.uk/sommerville to access a full range of resources for students and instructors. In addition, a rich collection of resources including links to other web sites, teaching material on related courses and additional chapters is available at http://www.software-engin.com .
